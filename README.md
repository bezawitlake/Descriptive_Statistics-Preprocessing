# Descriptive_Statistics-Preprocessing for Numerical and Time Series Datasets
This repository includes code for performing descriptive analysis and preprocessing on numerical and time series datasets. The code is written in Python and uses the Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib libraries.

Descriptive Analysis
The descriptive analysis includes the following steps:
1. Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. Compute basic summary statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and percentiles for each numerical variable in the dataset.
3. Create visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and box plots to explore the distribution, relationships, and outliers in the data.
4. Compute the correlation coefficients between pairs of numerical variables to identify any linear relationships between variables
5. Identify and handle missing values, outliers, and other anomalies in the data.

Preprocessing
The preprocessing includes the following steps:

Feature engineering: Create new features or transform existing features to capture important information and patterns in the data.
Data normalization or scaling: Transform the data to have a common scale or range to improve the performance of some machine learning algorithms.
Data encoding: Convert categorical variables to numerical values to make them compatible with machine learning algorithms.
Splitting the data: Divide the data into training, validation, and testing sets to evaluate the performance of the machine learning model and avoid overfitting.
Time series preprocessing: For time series data, apply techniques such as smoothing, differencing, and decomposition to remove trends and seasonality in the data.

Example Code
The descriptive_analysis.py and preprocessing.py files in this repository provide example code for performing descriptive analysis and preprocessing on numerical and time series datasets. These files include comments explaining each step of the analysis and preprocessing.

Dataset
The data directory in this repository includes example datasets for numerical and time series data. These datasets are in CSV format and can be loaded into a Pandas DataFrame using the pd.read_csv() function.

Conclusion
Descriptive analysis and preprocessing are important steps in data analysis and machine learning. By following the steps outlined in this README file and using the example code provided, you can perform these steps on your own numerical and time series datasets.
